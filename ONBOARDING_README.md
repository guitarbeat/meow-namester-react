## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation
```jsx
import { OnboardingModal } from './components';
import useOnboarding from './hooks/useOnboarding';

function App() {
  const { showOnboarding, closeOnboarding, dontShowAgain } = useOnboarding();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your app content */}
      <OnboardingModal
        isOpen={showOnboarding}
        onClose={closeOnboarding}
        onDontShowAgain={dontShowAgain}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Resetting Onboarding
```jsx
// From anywhere in the app
const resetOnboarding = () => {
  localStorage.removeItem('catNameTournament_onboardingSeen');
  window.location.reload();
};
```

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Full support with all features
