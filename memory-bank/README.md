# Meow Namester Memory Bank

## Overview

This Memory Bank is a comprehensive documentation system for the Meow Namester project. It serves as the single source of truth for all project information, ensuring knowledge continuity across different development sessions and team members.

## Purpose

The Memory Bank provides:

- Clear documentation of project requirements and goals
- Technical context and architectural decisions
- Current development status and progress tracking
- Active development focus and next steps
- Cross-referencing between documentation and implementation files

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of several core files, each serving a specific purpose:

- **projectbrief.md**: Foundation document defining core requirements and project scope
- **productContext.md**: Information about why this project exists and how it should work
- **systemPatterns.md**: System architecture, technical decisions, and design patterns
- **techContext.md**: Technologies used, development setup, and dependencies
- **activeContext.md**: Current focus, recent changes, and next steps
- **progress.md**: What works, what's left to build, and known issues
- **fileReferences.md**: Comprehensive index of implementation files and their documentation

Additionally, the `.projectrules` file captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence.

## How to Use This Memory Bank

1. **Start with Project Brief**: Begin by reading the `projectbrief.md` to understand the core purpose and requirements.
2. **Review Product and Technical Context**: Next, explore `productContext.md` and `techContext.md` to understand the problem being solved and how.
3. **Check Current Status**: Review `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to understand the current state of development.
4. **Find Specific Files**: Use `fileReferences.md` to locate specific implementation files related to documentation.
5. **Update Regularly**: Maintain these documents by updating them when making significant changes to the project.

## Workflow Guidelines

- **Starting a New Task**: Read ALL Memory Bank files before beginning work
- **Completing a Task**: Update relevant Memory Bank files to document changes
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the Memory Bank current with project developments

## Document Ownership

Every developer working on this project is responsible for maintaining and updating the Memory Bank. This is a shared responsibility to ensure project continuity and knowledge preservation.
