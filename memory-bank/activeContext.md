## Current Focus
The project is currently focused on documenting the codebase through the Memory Bank system to improve project maintainability and onboarding. This is a significant improvement to ensure knowledge continuity and provide a comprehensive overview of the project's structure, purpose, and technical details.

## Recent Changes
- **March 28, 2023**: Updates to sidebar component (src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.js)
- **March 28, 2023**: Enhancements to login component (src/components/Login/Login.js)
- **March 28, 2023**: Added BongoCat animation component (src/components/BongoCat/BongoCat.js)
- **March 27, 2023**: Updates to tournament logic in useTournament hook (src/hooks/useTournament.js)
- **March 26, 2023**: Enhanced results display with new charts (src/components/Results/Results.js)
- **March 26, 2023**: Added CalendarButton component (src/components/CalendarButton/CalendarButton.js)

## Next Steps
1. Implement Memory Bank documentation for remaining areas of the application
2. Update the UI components to use the latest React 19 features where applicable
3. Enhance the Results view with additional visualization options
4. Add more comprehensive error handling throughout the application
5. Implement automated testing for critical components
6. Optimize database queries for performance improvements
7. Enhance mobile responsiveness for better small screen experience

## Active Decisions
- **Component Architecture Refinement**: Evaluating if certain components should be split into smaller, more focused components - In progress
- **State Management Approach**: Considering if custom hooks are sufficient or if a more formal state management solution is needed - Under evaluation
- **Performance Optimization**: Identifying bottlenecks in the tournament rendering process - Investigation ongoing
- **Internationalization Support**: Evaluating the addition of i18n support for multiple languages - Planning phase

## Open Questions
- Should we migrate from CSS Modules to a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components?
- What additional analytics should we capture about user voting patterns?
- How can we improve the personalization of name recommendations?
- Should we implement server-side rendering for improved SEO and initial load performance?
- What additional features would provide the most value to users?
