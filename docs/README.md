- Support for viewing and managing user profiles
- Enable users to add new cat name suggestions

## **Success Criteria**
- Users can complete a cat name tournament and receive personalized recommendations
- The system accurately tracks and updates cat name ratings based on user votes
- Users can easily navigate the application and understand the tournament process
- The application successfully stores and retrieves user data and preferences
- The UI is responsive and works well on various devices

## **Constraints**
