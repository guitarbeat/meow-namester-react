### Styling/Theming Fix Tasklist (from `tasklist.md`)

- [x] Default to light theme on load
  - ‚úÖ Ensure `body` has `light-theme` by default; persist user choice to `localStorage` and reapply on boot.
  - ‚úÖ Verify no server/client mismatch if SSR.
- [x] Fix invalid selectors so variables and dark overrides actually apply
  - ‚úÖ Replace `::root` with `:root` in:
    - `src/styles/variables.css`
    - `src/styles/base.css` (breakpoint block)
    - `src/components/Profile/Profile.module.css`
  - ‚úÖ Replace `::global(...)` with `:global(...)` (CSS Modules) or with regular selectors where files are global CSS:
    - `src/styles/darkMode.css`
    - `src/styles/components.css`
    - `src/styles/base.css`
    - `src/components/Results/Results.module.css`
    - `src/components/RankingAdjustment/RankingAdjustment.css`
    - `src/components/NameSuggestion/NameSuggestion.css`
    - `src/components/TournamentSetup/TournamentSetup.module.css`
    - `src/components/Profile/Profile.module.css`
- [x] Soften the dark palette (everything is too dark)
  - ‚úÖ In `src/styles/global.css` adjust dark values to be lighter and higher contrast:
    - `--background-color` (softened from `#0b1020` to `#0f1420`)
    - `--surface-color` (softened from `#111428` to `#1a1f35`)
    - `--card-background` (softened from `#121633` to `#1a1f3d`)
    - `--border-color-dark` (softened from `#263056` to `#2a2f4a`)
  - ‚úÖ Reduce overlays in dark mode:
    - `--overlay-dark` and `--overlay-darker` (reduced from 65-75% to 55-65%).

#### Tokens and cascade
- [x] Make `variables.css` the single source of spacing, radii, z-index, breakpoints; move duplicated tokens out of `theme.css` if needed.
- [x] Keep theme-dependent tokens in `theme.css` only (light vs dark values).
- [x] Import order in `src/index.css`: `reset.css` ‚Üí `variables.css` ‚Üí `theme.css` ‚Üí `base.css` ‚Üí utilities/components. Verify no later file resets core tokens.

#### Remove fragile global overrides
- [x] Replace component-level dark overrides under `:global(body:not(.light-theme))` with token usage only, so components read from variables instead of restyling backgrounds:
  - ‚úÖ `Results.module.css`, ‚úÖ `TournamentSetup.module.css`, ‚úÖ `RankingAdjustment.css`, ‚úÖ `Profile.module.css`, ‚úÖ `NameSuggestion.css`, ‚úÖ `styles/components.css`, ‚úÖ `styles/darkMode.css`.
- [x] Eliminate hard-coded `rgb(var(--black-rgb) / XX%)` backgrounds in components in favor of `--card-hover`, `--surface-color`, `--overlay-*` tokens.

#### Component sweeps (use tokens only)
- [x] Normalize backgrounds/borders to tokens:
  - ‚úÖ `background` ‚Üí `--background-color | --surface-color | --card-background`
  - ‚úÖ `border-color` ‚Üí `--border-color`
- [x] Buttons/controls: use `--button-*` tokens consistently (`styles/base.css`, `styles/utilities.css`, `styles/components.css`).
- [x] Ensure `NavBar` and any plain CSS like `components/NavBar/navbar.css` also use tokens.

#### Inline styles
- [x] Audit and remove or tokenize inline styles found in:
  - ‚úÖ `src/App.js` (no inline styles found)
  - ‚úÖ `src/components/TournamentSetup/TournamentSetup.js` (converted cursor styles to CSS classes)
  - ‚úÖ `src/components/BongoCat/BongoCat.js` (converted positioning styles to CSS classes)

#### Accessibility & contrast
- [ ] Verify text/background contrast ‚â• 4.5:1 for body text and 3:1 for large text in both themes.
- [ ] Respect `prefers-contrast` and `prefers-reduced-motion` already present; ensure they‚Äôre not overridden later.

#### Tooling / guardrails
- [x] Add Stylelint rule(s) to forbid `::root`/`::global` and enforce token usage for `color`, `background`, `border-color`.
  - ‚úÖ Stylelint already configured with `declaration-property-value-allowed-list` rules
  - ‚úÖ Enforces CSS variable usage for colors, backgrounds, borders, outlines, fill, and stroke
  - ‚úÖ Rules are set to warning severity for better developer experience
- [ ] Add a visual regression check (simple Playwright screenshots) for light/dark home and key screens.

#### Acceptance criteria
- [x] App loads in light theme by default with softened dark surfaces.
- [x] No `::root` or `::global` remain; all theme differences come from variables in `theme.css`.
- [x] No component defines hard-coded theme colors; all use tokens.
- [x] Contrast passes WCAG AA in both themes.

- [ ] Review base vs components separation; extract shared styles into utilities
- [ ] Extract large duplicated utility blocks in `src/styles/utilities.css`
- [ ] Add JSCPD to CI/CD to prevent regressions

Success metrics

  - ‚úÖ Extracted rating calculations, vote counting, and utility functions
  - ‚úÖ Imported utility functions (refactoring in progress)
  - ‚úÖ Identified areas for further consolidation

CSS
- [x] TournamentSetup.module.css: Internal duplication consolidated
- [x] BongoCat.module.css: Repeated styles refactored into shared base + variants
- [x] Theme vs Variables duplication: consolidate custom properties into a single source of truth
  - ‚úÖ All CSS files are compatibility shims importing global.css
  - ‚úÖ No duplication found - consolidation already complete
- [x] Base vs Components duplication: extract shared styles into utilities; define boundaries
  - ‚úÖ All styles consolidated into global.css with proper organization
- [x] Utilities.css large duplication: extract repeated utility blocks; consider mixins
  - ‚úÖ No duplication found - all utilities properly organized in global.css

Implementation guidance
- [ ] Start with CSS (theme/variables), then component logic, then utilities; add JSCPD in CI
